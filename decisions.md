## 2026-07-19T00:00:00Z · 1.1 · Repo initialized for the Natural course

Created the local repo and a private GitHub repo under `peopleforrester`. The
course teaches the Natural mainframe language using the VTT model (instructions
left, terminal right) adapted from the "Unleash an Agent, Watch It Burn"
workshop. Private at first per Michael's instruction; opened only after the
spec and initial content are ready.

Decided: research lands in this repo's `research/` directory (course-specific
and voluminous) rather than only as mrf-knowledge spikes. Framework-level
findings (emulator/WASM feasibility) may also be promoted to a spike later.

## 2026-07-19T00:00:00Z · 1.2 · Course spec drafted from five research spikes

Synthesized spikes 01 to 05 into `spec/course-spec.md`. Key decisions proposed:

- Architecture: a custom Natural-subset interpreter in Rust, compiled to WASM,
  running fully client-side against xterm.js. Native CLI in a ttyd container is the
  fallback. Rejected hosting the free Community Edition (personal-use-only license)
  and a scripted fake terminal.
- Course: 16 modules in three delivery tiers (Tier 1 = modules 1 to 9, fully
  interactive in the browser).
- Corrected the founding premise: UT is a major operational USER of Natural/ADABAS,
  not a school that teaches it for credit. Positioning shifts to the enterprise and
  government skills gap.

Alternatives considered and set aside: hosting the vendor runtime per student (legal
wall), a purely scripted terminal (no durable learning). Awaiting Phase 1.3 approval
and answers to the four open questions in spec section 8 before any construction.
